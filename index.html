            <h1>Welcome to CALL of DUTY:warzone</h1>
            <P>Call of Duty: Warzone is a free-to-play, battle royale shooter developed by Infinity Ward and Raven Software and published by Activision. Released in March 2020, Warzone quickly became one of the most popular multiplayer games in the world, offering fast-paced combat, massive open maps, and a unique blend of tactical and arcade-style gameplay. 
            Set in the gritty and realistic universe of the Call of Duty franchise, Warzone stands out with its cinematic visuals, dynamic gameplay mechanics, and a constantly evolving world shaped by seasonal content and narrative events.</P>
            <br>
            <p>Unlike traditional battle royale games, Warzone introduces innovative features like the Gulag, which gives eliminated players a chance to fight for redeployment, and Loadout Drops, allowing players to use their customized weapons mid-match.
            With support for up to 150 players per match and cross-platform play across consoles and PC, Warzone has built a massive, global community of both casual players and competitive gamers</p>
            <h1>Community</h1>
            <p>The Warzone community is a massive, global group made up of casual players, competitive gamers, and popular streamers. They’re highly active on platforms like Reddit, Discord, Twitch, and TikTok, where they share gameplay clips, debate the best loadouts, and give feedback on game updates. While known for creativity and passion, the community often raises concerns about cheating, 
            skill-based matchmaking, and game balance. Overall, it’s a dynamic and engaged community that plays a big role in shaping the game's future.</p>
            <h1>Gameplay</h1>
            <p>Warzone is a fast-paced, first-person shooter battle royale where up to 150 players drop into a large map and fight to be the last squad or player standing. It combines tactical gunfights, team coordination, and high mobility with elements unique to the Call of Duty franchise</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Battle Royale Mode: Players parachute onto a huge map, loot weapons and gear, and survive as the circle shrinks.</li>
                <li>Gulag: When eliminated, players get a second chance by winning a 1v1 fight in a prison arena.</li>
                <li>Loadouts: Players can buy or find custom weapons and perks, giving them a personal edge mid-game.</li>
                <li>Cash & Buy Stations: Money earned in-game can be used to purchase UAVs, self-revives, killstreaks, and loadout drops.</li>
                <li>Contracts: Side missions (like Bounties or Scavengers) offer rewards and help players progress.</li>
            </ul>
